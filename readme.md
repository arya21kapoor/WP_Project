The Coronavirus pandemic has significantly increased retail participation in the stock market as many people have moved towards trading in the share market. Our project is prepared to keep in mind the needs of people to be more aware of the basics of fundamentally analyzing a company and coming out with a recommendation system as per the needs of the investor’s desires. With recommendation fields in growth, value, debt-reduction, and magic formula, the website provides a ranking of the top 50 companies by Market Capitalization listed on the stock exchanges.  

One of the main functions of the website interface is to provide a good amount of information to the user about the Profit & Loss, Balance Sheets, Quarters Sheet and Cash Flow sheet of each company in each sector.
Another main function of the website interface is to provide a good stock (company) recommendation system based on the user’s needs. The system recommends the Top 10 Value Stocks, the Top 10 Growth Stocks, the Top 10 Debt reduction Stocks, and the top 10 Magic Formula Stocks. The system uses MCDA (Multiple-criteria decision analysis) for recommending the different stocks.
Another feature of the website is that it displays the companies (within a sector) according to the increasing/decreasing order of their Market Capitalization, Price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), and Profit Growth.

Navigate through our project as follows:
There are two folders - API_database and Website.
The API_database folder contains the database files in CSV format.
It also contains the API implementation for company information, sector ranking, and MCDA rankings.
The website folder contains the static files in our website such as images and javascipt code. 
It also contains the front-end files of our website pages such as home, about us, contact us, top 10 rankings, sector ranking.
application.py file is for starting the project from our servers locally and rendering the front-end along with the back-end.
